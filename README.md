# **Whale Talk**

The Whale Talk program translates regular human language to whale talk. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus), has been an invaluable exercise in applying the knowledge I learned in learning to declare variables using C++.

## Project Prompt

Takes a phrase like `"turpentine and turtles"` and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent, `"uueeieeauuee"`.

There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:

- There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding the letter y.
- The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them.

Once we have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is custom in the ocean.

Write a `whale.cpp` program that accomplishes this translation using loops and vectors.

## Technologies

- C++

## Setup

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download `whale.cpp`.
2. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file resides.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

### Command Line / Bash

```git
g++ whale.cpp -o whale
./whale
```

### Command Prompt

```git
g++ whale.cpp -o whale
whale.exe
```

## Sources

The techniques utilized was based on the lessons taught in [Codecademy's Learn C++ Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus
). The challenge is also provided by Codecademy.
